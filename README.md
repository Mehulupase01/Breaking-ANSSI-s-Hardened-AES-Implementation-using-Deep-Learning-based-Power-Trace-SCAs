# Breaking ANSSI's Hardened AES Implementation using Deep-Learning based Power-Trace SCAs
 This project evaluates the vulnerability of ANSSIâ€™s masked AES to side-channel attacks (SCA) using deep learning models. It explores the effects of masking and shuffling countermeasures and utilizes Multi-Task Learning (MTL) to recover encryption keys from power traces effectively
